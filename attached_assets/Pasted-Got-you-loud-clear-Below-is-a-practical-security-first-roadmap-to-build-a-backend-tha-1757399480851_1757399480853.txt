Got you — loud & clear. 🔥🧠 Below is a practical, security-first **roadmap** to build a backend that reliably hosts / proxies \~18 models (you uploaded a curl list with many model endpoints — gemini, gpt-5, flux-pro, voice, image/video, etc.). I used your uploaded file as input.&#x20;

I’ll keep this focused, actionable and security-heavy (including the client’s Arabic request about token generation and request-ID protection). No fluff — ready to copy into tickets or hand to your engineer.

# 1 — High-level architecture (the bones)

```
Clients -> API Gateway (Auth + Rate limiting + WAF) -> Model Router Service
                │                           │
                │                           ├─ Model Worker Pool (per model or grouped)
                │                           │    └─ Calls to internal/external model endpoints
                │                           └─ Orchestration & Queueing (Redis/RabbitMQ)
                └─ Auth Service (Token minting, API keys, OAuth2)
```

Key components:

* **API Gateway** (Traefik/Envoy/Kong) — central entry, TLS, WAF rules, TLS client auth optional.
* **Auth Service / Token Issuer** — issues short-lived tokens, refresh, signed with rotating keys.
* **Model Router** — single service that maps requests -> specific model worker or external provider.
* **Per-Model Workers / Connectors** — encapsulate each model (18 connectors); keep them isolated for fault tolerance.
* **Queue & Worker Pool** (Redis streams / RabbitMQ) — async processing + concurrency control for heavy models.
* **Cache** (Redis) — dedupe identical requests, caching short results to save cost/time.
* **Monitoring + Logging** — Prometheus + Grafana, ELK or Loki, Sentry.
* **Secrets & Key Management** — HashiCorp Vault / cloud KMS.
* **DB** — PostgreSQL for persistent metadata (clients, tokens, quotas), Redis for ephemeral data (nonces, rate limiting).

# 2 — Core security features (client asked: توليد توكنات و معرف الطلب + منع سحب اتصال الـ API)

Priority list (must-haves):

1. **Short-lived signed access tokens (JWT or opaque)**

   * Use **JWT RS256** (or EdDSA) with `kid` header and rotating keys in Vault.
   * Keep lifetime short (e.g., seconds–minutes) and require refresh token for longer sessions.
2. **Refresh tokens with rotation & revocation**

   * Store refresh token state hashed in DB; rotate and immediately revoke old refresh on use.
3. **Per-client API keys (hashed)** + scopes & quotas

   * Hash keys (e.g., bcrypt) in DB; bind to client record, allowed models, rate limits.
4. **Per-request signature (HMAC) + timestamp + nonce** — prevents token scraping and replay:

   * Client signs `HMAC(secret, METHOD + PATH + TIMESTAMP + BODY_HASH)` -> sends `X-Signature` + `X-Timestamp` + `X-Request-ID`.
   * Server verifies signature, checks timestamp window (e.g., ±30s) and unique nonce/Request-ID in Redis (store for TTL) to prevent reuse.
5. **Request ID (UUIDv4) - mandatory header**

   * `X-Request-ID` generated by client or gateway; gateway generates if missing. Must be logged and returned in response.
6. **Rate limiting & throttles** (per API key, per IP, per model) — token bucket in Redis.
7. **IP allowlist & device fingerprinting** (optional for sensitive clients).
8. **mTLS for backend-to-backend** (when calling internal model endpoints).
9. **WAF / Input sanitization / size limits** to block abuse and huge payloads.
10. **Audit logs + alerting** on suspicious patterns (high token generation, high signature failures).

# 3 — Token & request-id design (concrete)

## Access token (JWT) payload example

```json
{
  "iss":"https://api.yourdomain.com",
  "sub":"client_12345",
  "aud":"model-service",
  "exp": 1694123456,
  "iat": 1694123200,
  "scope":"model:gemini-2.5-pro model:gpt-5 voice:tts",
  "jti":"<unique-token-id>"
}
```

* **Sign** with RS256 (private key in Vault). Publish `jwks` endpoint for verification in microservices.
* Store `jti` and `exp` in DB/Redis for forced revocation.

## HMAC per request (recommended for server-to-server)

* Client secret: `S` (rotateable)
* Client computes:

  * `timestamp = now_unix()`
  * `body_hash = SHA256(body)`
  * `string_to_sign = METHOD+"\n"+PATH+"\n"+timestamp+"\n"+body_hash`
  * `signature = HMAC_SHA256(S, string_to_sign)`
* Headers:

  * `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  * `X-Timestamp: <timestamp>`
  * `X-Signature: sha256=<signature>`
  * `X-Request-ID: <uuid4>`
* Server verifies:

  * Check `|now - timestamp| <= allowed_window`
  * Recompute and compare HMAC (use constant-time compare)
  * Reject if `X-Request-ID` seen before (store in Redis with TTL equal to window)

# 4 — Model orchestration & “run all 18 models” behavior

Options (choose based on latency vs cost):

* **Parallel fan-out:** API receives request -> Router fans out to all 18 model workers in parallel -> collects responses -> returns aggregated result.

  * Needs concurrency control & timeout per model. Use **circuit breakers** (Hystrix-like).
* **Sequential / prioritized:** Run top N (fast) then run rest async; return immediate best answer and background cache others.
* **Hybrid:** “Run All” mode (explicit) — limited to premium clients, queued with job monitoring.

Technical pattern:

* **Router** calls each **Connector** via RPC or HTTP with per-model timeouts and a worker pool. Connectors can be scaled independently.
* Use **bulkhead isolation**: heavy models have separate worker pools and quotas.
* **Result aggregation** service: merges responses, ranks results, dedupes, attaches provenance metadata (model name, latency, token usage).

# 5 — Example middleware (Node.js — verify HMAC + JWT)

```js
// express middleware (simplified)
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const crypto = require('crypto');

async function authMiddleware(req, res, next){
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  const sig = req.headers['x-signature'];
  const ts = req.headers['x-timestamp'];
  const rid = req.headers['x-request-id'];

  if(!token) return res.status(401).send('no token');

  // 1) verify JWT (RS256)
  try {
    const payload = jwt.verify(token, PUBLIC_KEY, { algorithms:['RS256'] });
    req.client = payload.sub;
  } catch(e){ return res.status(401).send('invalid token'); }

  // 2) Verify timestamp window
  if(Math.abs(Date.now()/1000 - parseInt(ts)) > 30) return res.status(400).send('timestamp out of window');

  // 3) Recompute HMAC
  const bodyHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(JSON.stringify(req.body || '')).digest('hex');
  const stringToSign = `${req.method}\n${req.path}\n${ts}\n${bodyHash}`;
  const secret = await getClientSecret(req.client); // from DB/Hash
  const expected = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(stringToSign).digest('hex');

  if(!crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected,'hex'), Buffer.from(sig,'hex'))) {
    return res.status(401).send('invalid signature');
  }

  // 4) Check request-id uniqueness (Redis SETNX with TTL)
  const seen = await redis.setnx(`rid:${rid}`, '1');
  if(!seen) return res.status(400).send('replay detected');
  await redis.expire(`rid:${rid}`, 60);

  next();
}
```

# 6 — Data models (minimum schema)

**clients**

* id, name, hashed\_api\_key, client\_secret\_hash, scopes, rate\_limit\_profile, allowed\_models, created\_at, status

**access\_tokens**

* jti, client\_id, issued\_at, expires\_at, revoked\_flag

**requests**

* id (uuid), client\_id, path, method, status, response\_code, latency\_ms, model\_used, created\_at

**nonces (in Redis)**

* key: `rid:<uuid>`, ttl

# 7 — Observability & security ops

* **Metrics:** per-model latency, success rate, token issuance rate, signature failures.
* **Logging:** include `X-Request-ID` in all logs; store request/response hashes (not PII).
* **Alerts:** token misuse spikes, >N failed signatures per minute, high retries.
* **Pen tests & red team:** test token forgery, replay, race conditions.
* **Runtime secrets rotation**: rotate signing keys monthly and have key rollover support (keep old for verification short window).

# 8 — Dev & infra checklist (deliverables; NOT time estimates)

Phase A — foundation (deliverables)

* API Gateway + TLS + WAF
* Auth Service with JWT issuance & JWKS endpoint
* Vault / KMS integrated
* DB + Redis + message broker
* Simple Model Router + 2 connectors demonstrated

Phase B — scale & security

* Implement per-request HMAC + request-id replay store
* Rate limiting & quotas
* Per-model worker pools + circuit breakers
* Logging/monitoring dashboards

Phase C — production readiness

* Full test coverage (unit, integration)
* Canary deploys, blue/green or progressive rollout
* Pen testing, threat modeling
* SLA & incident runbook

Phase D — optimizations & cost control

* Caching + batching
* Response dedupe, result ranking
* Adaptive routing (choose cheaper/faster model)

# 9 — Devops & CI/CD (recommendations)

* IaC: Terraform for infra, Helm for k8s charts.
* CI: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI — build, test, security scans, container image signing.
* CD: ArgoCD / Flux for declarative k8s deploys.
* Canary & feature flags: LaunchDarkly or open-source flags.

# 10 — Testing matrix

* Unit tests for all connectors (mock external).
* Integration tests for token flows (including refresh).
* Security tests: signature replay, expired tokens, revoked tokens.
* Load test: per-model concurrency limits and gateway rate-limits.
* Chaos: kill a model worker to verify graceful degradation.

# 11 — Example hardening extras (optional but recommended)

* **Client PKI**: Issue client certs and require mTLS for high-privilege clients.
* **Proof of Work** attachment for public endpoints to hinder scraping.
* **Per-request cost accounting** to bill internal token usage and stop abusive clients.

# 12 — Example API contract (single endpoint)

`POST /v1/infer`
Headers:

* `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`
* `X-Signature: <hex>`
* `X-Timestamp: <unix>`
* `X-Request-ID: <uuid4>`
  Body:

```json
{
  "mode": "fanout|single|priority",
  "models": ["gemini-2.5-pro","gpt-5","flux-pro"], // optional; default = configured
  "input": { "text": "...", "images": [...] },
  "response_config": { "timeout_ms": 5000, "max_tokens": 1024 }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "request_id":"<uuid4>",
  "status":"accepted",
  "results":[
     {"model":"gemini-2.5-pro", "status":"ok", "latency_ms":123, "response":"..."},
     ...
  ]
}
```

# 13 — Minimal code & infra hints (secrets)

* Never store client secrets plaintext. Use `bcrypt`/`argon2` for API keys, HMAC secrets opaque hashed for rotation checks (but you need the raw secret to compute HMAC — store encrypted in Vault and only accessible to auth gateway).
* Use environment variables for config but keep secrets in Vault.
* Keep `jwks` public endpoint for microservices; rotate keys with overlap.

# 14 — How I’d split tasks (example buckets)

* Auth & tokens (issuer, rotator, revoke)
* Gateway (proxy + WAF + rate limit)
* Model connectors (1 ticket per model; standardized interface)
* Orchestration (router, aggregator, queue)
* Security (HMAC, request-id, nonce store)
* Observability (dashboards + alerts)
* Tests + CI/CD + infra

# 15 — Final checklist for “very secure, very organized, fully functional”

* [ ] Mandatory signed short-lived tokens + refresh rotation
* [ ] HMAC per request + timestamp + unique X-Request-ID + Redis nonce store
* [ ] Per-client hashed API keys + per-model scopes & quotas
* [ ] Gateway + WAF + rate-limiting + IP rules
* [ ] Per-model worker pools + circuit breakers + timeouts
* [ ] Central logging with request-id propagation
* [ ] Secrets stored in Vault / KMS; key rotation
* [ ] Monitoring, alerts and incident runbook
* [ ] Integration tests + security tests

---

If you want, I can immediately:

* produce a **ready-to-import task list** (Jira/Trello) with acceptance criteria and exact PR descriptions, or
* generate the **auth microservice skeleton** (Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL + Redis) with the token minting & HMAC verification middleware shown above, or
* create the **OpenAPI / Swagger spec** for `/v1/infer` + auth endpoints.

Which of those should I build next for you? (I’ll just produce it now — no waiting.)
